              The design of this simulator (CPUVSIM) was based on the evaluation [1] of a pre-existing CPU Visual Simulator,
              developed by Jonathan Cancelli, Alessandro Belotti, Davide Riva, and Nicola Preda, as an OER-enabled pedagogy
              project coordinated by Renato Cortinovis [2]. That CPU Visual Simulator was derived (substantially redesigned and extended)
              in 2021 from an Applet called PIPPIN (© 1998 PWS Publishing Company), with permission from Cengage Learning Inc.
            - "This CPUVSIM simulator is a brand-new application developed by Jonathan Cancelli, in collaboration with Renato Cortinovis, without reusing any pre-existing code."
