                    CPU Visual Simulator allows you to enter and visualize the execution of assembly language code.
                    Instructions and numeric data can be inserted or modified directly in RAM. It is possible to define
                    "labels" (identifiers to be used in place of memory addresses): these labels can then be used as 
                    parameters in jump instructions, or as variable identifiers. At any time, it is possible to switch 
                    between symbolic and binary representations. It is also possible to directly modify the Program 
                    Counter, the Accumulator or the Status Word's Negative and Zero flags. The program can be executed:
                    normally (the CPU continues to execute instructions until execution is paused or the program ends),
                    one statement at a time, or one step at a time. The text-to-speech function is also made available
                    which, if enabled, activates a synthetic voice that explains what is being executed by the CPU.

                    - "A valid direct operand must be a valid address, so it should be and even value between 0 and 254 or a valid label."

                The design of this simulator (CPUVSIM) was based on the evaluation [1] of a pre-existing CPU Visual Simulator,
                developed by Jonathan Cancelli, Alessandro Belotti, Davide Riva, and Nicola Preda, as an OER-enabled pedagogy
                project coordinated by Renato Cortinovis [2]. That CPU Visual Simulator was derived (substantially redesigned and extended)
                in 2021 from an Applet called PIPPIN (Â© 1998 PWS Publishing Company), with permission from Cengage Learning Inc.
              - "This CPUVSIM simulator is a brand-new application developed by Jonathan Cancelli, in collaboration with Renato Cortinovis, without reusing any pre-existing code."
