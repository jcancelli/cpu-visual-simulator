          CPU Visual Simulator allows you to enter and visualize the execution of assembly language code.
          Instructions and numeric data can be inserted or modified directly in RAM. It is possible to define
          "labels" (identifiers to be used in place of memory addresses): these labels can then be used as 
          parameters in jump instructions, or as variable identifiers. At any time, it is possible to switch 
          between symbolic and binary representations. It is also possible to directly modify the Program 
          Counter, the Accumulator or the Status Word's Negative and Zero flags. The program can be executed:
          normally (the CPU continues to execute instructions until execution is paused or the program ends),
          one statement at a time, or one step at a time. The text-to-speech function is also made available
          which, if enabled, activates a synthetic voice that explains what is being executed by the CPU.

            paragraphs:
              - 'An immediate operand is an operand preceded by the "#" symbol.'
              - "The value of an immediate operand must be in the 8-bit range (127 to -128)."
              - "If the operand is a label, the address at which that label is associated will be used as operand."
          direct:
            title: "Direct"
            paragraphs:
              - 'An operand with no "#" symbol is a direct operand.'
              - "A direct operand represent the address at which the operand value is stored."
              - "A valid direct operand must be a valid address, so it should be and even value between 0 and 254 or a valid label."

        paragraphs:
          - "In a .cpuvs file, each line may contain a single instruction."
          - "A line that doesn't contain a valid instruction may only contain a comment."
          - "Empty lines are allowed and will be ignored."
          - "The content of each line will be stored in a memory address starting from address 0."
          - "Empty lines or lines that contains only a comment will be ignored."
      syntax:
        title: "Syntax"
        paragraphs:
          - "A valid line has the following format: 'LABEL: INSTRUCTION' (without single quotes)."
          - 'LABEL: This field is optional. If this field is omitted, the ":" symbol should also be omitted.'
          - "INSTRUCTION: This field represents the content of an address. The syntax is identical to the one used to input instructions directly into the RAM and everything that can be written into a RAM cell can be written here (except binary input)."
          - "Leading and trailing whitespaces and tab characters are ignored."
          - "If the file you are trying to load into CPUVS contains an error, an error message with the details of the error will be displayed on the top edge of the simulator."
          - 'A comment is defined as everything that follows the symbol ";" until a new line.'
